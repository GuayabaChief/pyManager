# pyManager

## In trouble with Excel-based Databases for inventories? And you want/need to have an analysis with SQL data too?
PyManager attempts to be the solution do you need, this is a small program powered by Python code, built for use CSV files as a datasource, a file type equivalent or modifiable by Microsoft Excel.

## Why I do this?
I was so bored in my work, and i didn´t has access to the database, but all the information was in a Excel file, and I had the assignment to do a inventory...
Well, what a problem, right?

## What I'm trying to do?
Transform Excel files to CSV, and do CRUD operations without using Excel, administrate products, and be flexible for all the people that wants to use their CSV files like a database, or can´t transform their data into SQL datasource, using similar logic as a ERP software but only the module for inventories, and maybe in future add the module of visualizations of all the operations and management of the inventory.
